# Hi there 👋

## About Me 📝
🎓 My name is Ronnie Ortiz and I'm currntly a 2nd year MBA student at the University of Notre Dame. Before that, I did my undergrad degree in Accounting and Finance at Marquette University. 

🧑🏻‍💻 Over the last year, I've becoming really interested in computer science and coding. So far, I've gotten pretty comfortable with SQL, Python and its pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. I've also recently begun learning C++.

⚾️ Before I started coding, I was a financial analyst and used Excel a ton. I'd originally learned Excel from my interest in baseball analytics. As I started to run into the limits of that program, I got interested in learning Python to keep up with my hobby. When I'm not in school or working on a project here, you'll probably find me watching Yankees baseball!

📕 Another of my favorite hobbies is reading! I read a lot of business books and biogrpahies. If you have any recommendations, let me know! Right now, I'm reading "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" by Charles Petzold.
